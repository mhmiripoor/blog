### Easy to use, Free for all

## What's this?
Wanna spin up a small blog on GitHub Pages real quick and post your stuff with zero hassle?
BoneLOG is made just for that.

Just write your posts in Markdown, push them, and boom — they go live automatically.

And hey, if someday you decide to move to a fancier blog with a database and more features, you're still covered. Just run a simple script to import your posts — no app lock-in, no pain.

## How to get started?
- Fork this repo
- Enable GitHub Actions
- And start editing or adding your content in this path
[/src/BoneLog.Blazor/wwwroot/data](/src/BoneLog.Blazor/wwwroot/data)
- Finally, go to your repo settings, enable GitHub Pages on the gh-pages branch — and you’re live!

> ⚠️ If you have GitHub Actions enabled, posts.json will be created automatically after each push.


## How to customize?
Everything you need is right there in
[/src/BoneLog.Blazor/wwwroot/data](/src/BoneLog.Blazor/wwwroot/data)

Want more advanced customization? Go ahead — edit the files, tweak the look, and build your own version of BoneLog!
